                <p>
                   <b> Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Biography:</b> Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was an Indian Nationalist whose patriotism towards India has left a mark in the hearts of many Indians. He is famously known as the founder of 'Azad Hind Fauj' and his famous slogan is 'Tum Mujhe Khoon Do, Main Tumhe Aazadi Dunga'. Today we are celebrating his 126th Birth Anniversary as Parakram Diwas.
Today, on Parakram Diwas, I pay homage to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and recall his unparalleled contribution to Indiaâ€™s history. He will be remembered for his fierce resistance to colonial rule. Deeply influenced by his thoughts, we are working to realise his vision for India.
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was born on  23 January,1897 in Cuttack, Orissa and he died on 18 August,1945, in a hospital in Taiwan after suffering from burn injuries sustained in a plane crash. 
Subhas Chandra Bose is considered the most influential freedom fighter with extraordinary leadership skills and a charismatic orator. His famous slogans are 'tum mujhe khoon do, main tumhe aazadi dunga', 'Jai Hind', and 'Delhi Chalo'. He formed Azad Hind Fauj and made several contributions to India's freedom struggle. He is known for his militant approach that he used to gain independence and for his socialist policies.
